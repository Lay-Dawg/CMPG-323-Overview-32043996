# Branching Strategy
A GitHub Flow branching strategy will be used for the projects development. <br>
<br>
**Where:** <br>
<br>
*A Primary branch where all code will be branched off from. This is the Master Branch. <br>
*New Branches will be created for bugs and features. <br>
*When code is reviewed and approved it will be merged to the Master Branch and deployed to the Master Branch. <br>

# Git Ignore
By ignoring certain files when commiting projects to GitHub Repositories, will allow the protection of confidential information from being leaked or tracked for that matter.

# Sensitive Information and Credential Storage
Information containing anything of sensitive value will be stored only locally as online distribution would decrease confindentiality. Temporary files will fill their role for testing purposes when submitted to the Main.
